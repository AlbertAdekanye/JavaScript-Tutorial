// JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications. It is complimentary to and integrated with Java. JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
// Just to give you a little excitement about Javascript programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional Javascript Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link
// Live Demo

{/* <html>
   <body>   
      <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            document.write("Hello World!")
         //-->
      </script>      
   </body>
</html> */}

// JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the <script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.

// You can place the <script> tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the <head> tags.

// The <script> tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as a script. A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows.

// JavaScript also defines two trivial data types, null and undefined, each of which defines only a single value. In addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as object

// What is an Operator?

// Let us take a simple expression 4 + 5 is equal to 9. Here 4 and 5 are called operands and ‘+’ is called the operator. JavaScript supports the following types of operators.

//     Arithmetic Operators
//     Comparison Operators
//     Logical (or Relational) Operators
//     Assignment Operators
//     Conditional (or ternary) Operators

// if statement

// The if statement is the fundamental control statement that allows JavaScript to make decisions and execute statements conditionally.
// The objective of a switch statement is to give an expression to evaluate and several different statements to execute based on the value of the expression. The interpreter checks each case against the value of the expression until a match is found. If nothing matches, a default condition will be used.

// Learn Javascript Programming Language

//         The course is created thorough, extensive, but easy to follow content which you’ll easily understand and absorb.

//         The course starts with the basics, including JavaScript fundamentals, programming, and user interaction.


//         The curriculum is going to be very hands-on as we walk you from start to finish to become a professional Javascript developer. We will start from the very beginning by teaching you Javascript basics and programming fundamentals, and then execute into real-life practice and be ready for the real world.


//         While Javascript is complicated for beginners to learn, it is widely used in many web development areas.

//         This course gets you started with an introduction to JavaScript. It assumes that you're new to the language, so it gets you started with basic functionality such as creating functions, creating variables, and calling these lines of code from your standard HTML pages. It talks about events and triggers for custom event handling. It talks about pattern matching, searching for text within a page, flow control and the document object model (DOM). We start off with the basics and move on to more complex functionality such as arrays and objects. We then discuss how to script common elements with JavaScript such as forms and tables. At the very end, we discuss major libraries such as Ajax, which allows you to make asynchronous calls to server-side scripts without reloading the web page in the server.
